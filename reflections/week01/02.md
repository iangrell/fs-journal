## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo-class defines special states of an element such as a style change to to the color of a button when the cursor hovers over it or a link has been clicked. 

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is built into CSS which assigns numerical values to different rules that are applied to the same element, so the correct rule will be followed.  

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

!important will override all other style rules, except for another !important.  Over-use of this can lead to confusion in the code and make it difficult to correct errors or make changes.
