# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I am very excited to start this program and think I was able to solve some of my own struggles this week.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

I was unaware of bootstrap and how useful a tool it is.

- What are you struggling with?

I don't think I have a very strong understanding flex boxes, or sizing containers in general and I will submit a tutor request to address this. Being very sick this week made it hard to pay full attention, this added extra stress to this week knowing that is not a great way to start this program.  I am doing my best to put the stress of that behind me and focus on doing what I need to do to move forward and continue to learn what I can. 

- What would you count as a victory?

I know it may be premature, but I think I did fairly well on my first checkpoint.  There was one requirement I was not able to complete but I think I was successful on all the others.  I could be very wrong about this though.
