## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope describes where a variable is defined, either globally or blocked/functionally/locally.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting is describing when variable are moved to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

It seems like in most cases, it is better to use either `let` or `const` instead of `var`. Const is use to assign a value that cannot be changed or updated, while let can be updated.
