# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Just building on top of what I learned the week before and starting to get a base of knowledge.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Web development and coding are completely new to me and I am just trying to learn as much as I can, there is so much I don't know that I can't really identify something that shocked or surprised me.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling with writing JavaScript without a direct reference. once I see it, I feel like I understand it for the most part, but without that I easily get lost.

- What would you count as a victory?

I was able to get a fair portion of the requirements for this weeks outline completed while in lab, I thought I was more lost than that and it was going to take me longer to complete.
