## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and restricts the access of that data from outside the bundle.

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

The problem with the underscore prefix is that it was a roundabout way to solve the problem of making objects private prior to the private fields proposal.  New developers may not be aware of this old convention.  

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this?

Private variables are useful because they allow the developer to add objects or functions that the user will not have access to.
