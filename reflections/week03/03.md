## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the ***handler***?

The handler will contain the object with the original values but the the basic operations will have custom logic specified in the handler.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every `get` to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

The get operators need to take in two parameters, the object and the property being accessed.

3. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Proxies allow for objects to be private but have a key to access the information.
