# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week? 

I'm told by TA's that I'm on track

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Overall, the MVC pattern was surprising and interesting.  I like the structure and flow, even though I don't have a good grasp yet.

- What are you struggling with?

Still struggling with writing functions and so far the checkpoints are taking me the entire weekend, about 12 hours a day and it's really wearing on me.

- What would you count as a victory?

Not sure.
