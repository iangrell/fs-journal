> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of 'callback hell'?'

Callback hell is when too many callbacks or asynchronous code is used together.  This can be visible with a pyramid structure and many '})' at the end

2. What does ***asynchronous*** mean, and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous code means that function will not run right now or be delayed until another function is completed.  Callbacks is just a naming convention that describes a function that takes some time to return a result.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid/fix 'callback hell.'

- Keep your code shallow - This describes naming individual functions, which allows for better readability and organization.

- Modularize - Create modules that do 1 thing, then you can group similar modules into larger modules.  This allows the modules to be accessed for other parts of code and keeps it organized.

- Handle every error - This describes making your code stable by reviewing and fixing errors. BY having the first argument be the 'error' and using code linters is a good way to identify and find all errors.
