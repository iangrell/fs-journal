## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, resolved, or rejected.

2. How do `Promise`s seek to resolve the issues of 'callback hell'?

When having multiple callbacks and attaching them to promises then chaining them together will keep the code more organized and readable which will help prevent callback hell.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

the then method is used after a promise is returned as resolved, the catch method is used if it returns rejected.  Each will describe what to do next depending on how the promise is returned.
