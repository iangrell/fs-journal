# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I'm still passing the course

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

Again, I have little to no experience with this field, just trying to take in as much as I can.

- What are you struggling with?

I feel like I'm missing something basic, I constantly struggle through almost every part of the checkpoints and get stuck on things that I have a feeling are simple.

- What would you count as a victory?

Not feeling too victorious lately.
