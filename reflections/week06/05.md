# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think vue is starting to come together.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

How vue works, writing html, css and js on the same page.

- What are you struggling with?

I still feel I am a bit slow while coding, really need to think about how things work.

- What would you count as a victory?

I feel like all the knowledge is starting to come together a bit more.
