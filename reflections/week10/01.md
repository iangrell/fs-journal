## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type - these directly contain the value.
Reference Type - contain a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
Pointer Type - contains memory address of another type.

2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

These data types are much more specific than JavaScript.  They include, bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, strct, uint, ulong, ushort.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

They are stored at a separate location so that if the variable changes, that change will be reflected in any method using it.
