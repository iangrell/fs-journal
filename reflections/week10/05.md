# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think I will like C#, but don't have a good grasp on it yet.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

How much structure there is in C#.

- What are you struggling with?

I still have a hard time planning out what I need to do when starting a large project.

- What would you count as a victory?

Still here.
