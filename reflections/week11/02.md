## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

Primary Keys are unique pieces of information that can be used to identify records on a table.  A Primary Key can then be used as a Foreign Key to reference data on another table.  

2. What is an ***alias***?

An Alias is used after the first instance of the written table name and can be used to shorten the name in place of the full table name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
Select patients.* WHERE patients.id = doctors.patientId
