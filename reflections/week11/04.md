## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I am a bit concerned about maintaining all this knowledge but that will be on me to continue coding. I plan to keep busy Mon-Fri, splitting the day between job hunting and coding until I find a job.  I think I enjoyed the course overall, happy to be able to learn new skills in a short amount of time.
